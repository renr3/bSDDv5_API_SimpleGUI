This is a simple GUI implemented in Python for the bSDD v5 API (Official repo @ https://github.com/buildingSMART/bSDD).

The folder **Executable version** contains an .exe version obtained from pyinstaller. It allows a standalone use of the GUI outside your Python programming environment. To use it, download the folder **bSDDv5_Main_SimpleGUI** to your computer and run the file **bSDDv5_Main_SimpleGUI.exe**.
